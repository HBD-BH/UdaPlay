The movie—which is now streaming on Netflix and stars Archie Madekwe as Mardenborough, Orlando Bloom, and David Harbour—tells a dramatized version of how a teenaged Mardenborough beat more than 90,000 players around the world in the 2011 GT Academy to become a professional driver. [...] Described by his mother as “quite a home boy,” the shy Mardenborough instead retreated to his bedroom to play Gran Turismo. Unlike other arcade-style racing titles, the game series—which debuted in 1997 for the original PlayStation console—is meant to accurately simulate the look and feel of driving a race car. On modern consoles, the experience is almost photorealistic. [...] In the next round, Mardenborough drove an actual car at the Brands Hatch circuit in southeast England. He was one of two participants to advance to the final portion at Silverstone, which hosts the annual Formula 1 British Grand Prix. After more cuts were made, he was one of only four drivers left to compete in a winner-take-all race on the Silverstone circuit. “The only time I thought I’d have a chance of winning was when I qualified first,” he told Car Throttle. “It was just impossible.
